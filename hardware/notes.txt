SOP32 supports up to 512KB SRAM
pins 1,30 are A18 and A17, respectively, on AS6C4008 SRAM
--> this hw could have supported 1MB of SRAM
--> still could if two Tx pins are stolen and connected to pins 1,30 of the two SRAM chips

NitrOS needs 2MB of RAM for current version
--> expansion card with 2MB of SRAM and decoding
--> need provision in the FPGA to disable main RAM decoding (put into a soft SFR - RAMEN)

In retrospect, it would be cleaner to generate MA13..MA20 with a 74HC574, fed by LV DBUS
--> during non SFR access, put MA13...MA20 onto LV_D0..LV_D7 and clock into HC574
--> do this quickly (in 50 MHz FPGA clock domain) and well BEFORE WR# signal is asserted!

It would be cool to have the FLASH contained inside the FPGA user flash!
--> then the large DIP package can be eliminated
--> how to program/reprogram the FPGA flash in a nice way? (not using QUARTUS!)
--> consider adding the internal FLASH into the memory mapper (pages 41-...?)
