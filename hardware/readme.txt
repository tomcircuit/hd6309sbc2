This set of design files implements the Schematic and PCB for the HD6309 Singleboard Computer II

Design tool is KiCad 5.1.6

PCB was designed with one-off production in mind, and to my own set of (largely unwritten) PCB
design rules. The board is double sided 100 x 120mm, with 8/8 track/spacing (mils), and 0.4mm minimum
hole size. The two most complicated components to solder are the EQPF144 MAX10 CPLD and the QFN28
CP2105 USB bridge. The rest of the components are fairly straightforward to assemble.

PDF of the PCB and Schematic can be found in the "plots" directory.
Gerber and drill information can be found in the "fabrication" directory.

My PCBs were fabricated by PCBway https://www.pcbway.com/ and I chose 1.6mm FR4 with ENIG surface 
treatment to make fine-pitch SMD soldering easier. I had a polyamide stencil manufactured by OSHstencils
https://www.oshstencils.com/. This will be my first foray with solder stencil, hotplate, and hot air
soldering. It's long overdue, because so many components simply cannot be reliably hand-soldered anymore.
