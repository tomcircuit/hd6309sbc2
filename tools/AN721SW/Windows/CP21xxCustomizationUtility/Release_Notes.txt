Copyright (C) 2015 Silicon Laboratories, Inc.

KNOWN ISSUES AND LIMITATIONS
----------------------------

    1) Only CP210x, CP211x, and CP213x devices are supported by this
       application.
	
    2) This application does not support automatic refresh of devices.

    3) CP210x is only supported on Linux and Windows
	
    4) CP2130 is only supported on Windows
	
    5) Programming the serial number will display an incorrect failure
       due to improper reset functionality. This will be addressed in a
       future release.
	
    6) Changing the mode from GPIO to modem on a CP2105 will automatically
       change pin settings that don't reflect on the validation. This
